# Indenture
An editor for digital contracts

## What is this
1. Write or copy-paste the text of an agreement, statement or any text you want to have verifiable by one or more parties. You can use **markdown**.

2. Click the blue button to append a stamp section with an hash of the text and a timestamp. Make every other party do the same: timestamps will differ but the hash must be identical.

3. Click the green button to download a copy of the content with the stamp.

4. Digitally sign the text. You can use [keybase](https://keybase.io).

5. Send or publish your signed contract and get the other party's signed copy. If you use [keybase.pub](https://keybase.pub) you can just exchange links.

6. Everyone can now verify that **YOU** signed **THAT** text at **THAT** time. If there are multiple parties you can verify that they signed the same text by quickly checking the hashes.

This provides basic identity proof, integrity and non-repudiation with a few clicks and an easy-readable document.
